# This is an sws.yml file. It allows configuration to be stored on a developers'
# machine without having to be shared with others. It is ideal for storing any
# configuration specific to your machine or tokens, which should not be shared
# with others. Every sws.yml file should be paired with a corresponding
# sws.yml.example file. That file should have no sensitive data in it, but give
# another developer an idea of how to replicate your local config.

# The contents of this file are read in with
# `faoswsModules::ReadSettings("sws.yml")`.
# It is then available to R as a list.

current: qa # The current config set. Corresponds to a heading below
all: # This applies to all config sets, but is overridden by a specific config set

production: # This set is not being pointed to. To point to it, change 'current' to point to 'production'.
