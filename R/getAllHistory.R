##' Get All Production History
##' 
##' This function is used to pull the historical production values from the
##' database.  One main purpose of this data is to train machine learning
##' algorithms on invalid observations, and use those models to attempt to
##' detect invalid observations in the current data.
##' 
##' @param domain Domain from which to pull history
##' @param dataset Dataset from which to pull history
##' 
##' @return A data.table object with the following columns:
##' \itemize{
##'     \item geographicAreaM49: The code for the country of this observation.
##'     \item measuredElement: The code for the element of this observation 
##'     (these match with the "Element" dimension in the agriculture domain,
##'     for example 5312 is area harvested, 5510 is production, etc.).
##'     \item measuredItemCPC: The CPC code for the commodity.
##'     \item timePointYears: The year for this observation.
##'     \item Version: ?
##'     \item StartDate: The initial date this value was entered into the
##'     system.
##'     \item EndDate: The date that this value was overwritten.  If NA, this
##'     value is the current best estimate and is considered valid.  If not NA,
##'     this value is considered invalid.
##'     \item Metadata: ?
##'     \item Metadata_Language: An abbreviation for the language of the
##'     metadata comments.
##'     \item Metadata_Group: ?
##'     \item Metadata_Element: ?
##'     \item Metadata_Value: ?
##'     \item Value: The value stored in the database for this observation.
##'     \item flagObservationStatus: The flag corresponding to the observation
##'     status of the current observation.  See the faoswsFlag package for more
##'     details.
##'     \item flagMethod: The method flag for the current observation.  Again,
##'     see the faoswsFlag package.
##'     \item valid: A Y/N value indicating whether or not the current value is
##'     valid.  This is determined solely on the basis of whether or not this
##'     value was overwritten.
##'     \item productionValue: The value corresponding to production (element
##'     5510) for this particular observation.  This may be useful in training
##'     the classification ensemble.
